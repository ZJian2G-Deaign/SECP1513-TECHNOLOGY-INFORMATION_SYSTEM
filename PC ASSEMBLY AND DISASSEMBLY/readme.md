# My Reflection from PC ASSEMBLY AND DISASSEMBLY

The PC Assembly activity was my valuable learning experience, surpassing the typical classroom lecture. The hands-on experience of assembling and disassembling a computer from unsealing the case up to connecting every single component gave me deeper knowledge into how internal computer hardware works.

One of the big challenges I faced involved the installation of the power supply. I lost the direction as my attempts failed, which caused the computer unable to switch on. Then through the help from teacher, we managed to overcome this challenge (Computer could switch on). 

A deeper understanding with regard to computer hardware will improve my understanding in future computer science classes. Also, these hands-on skills will be of real-world value; whether in computer support, administration, or actual game development, an understanding of how to pinpoint and troubleshoot hardware problems will serve me very well.

In conclusion, the PC Assembly exercise has formed a strong basic foundation for pursuing the field of computer science in my future.
